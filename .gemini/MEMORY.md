# User Rules for this Project

## Verification Rules
- **Never take documentation at face value.** Always verify claims by checking the actual codebase before reporting status. Documentation can be outdated or incorrect.

## Critical Operational Rules
- **DO NOT OVER-INTERPRET broad instructions.** "Automate as much as possible" means finding tools and preparing steps, NOT executing destructive or final actions (like committing/pushing) without approval. Always default to asking for confirmation on significant state interactions.
- **Stop Audio After Testing**: When running browser tests involving audio, ALWAYS stop playback (pause or close page) before completing the task to prevent background noise buildup.
