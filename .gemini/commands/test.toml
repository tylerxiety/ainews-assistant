# Test & Validation

Run automated checks, code review, and functional testing. This is comprehensive verification.

## Part 1: Automated Checks

Run these, report PASS/FAIL for each:

1. **Backend types**: `cd backend && uv run mypy . --ignore-missing-imports`
2. **Frontend types**: `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Backend lint**: `cd backend && uv run ruff check .` (if configured)
4. **Frontend lint**: `cd frontend && npm run lint` (if configured)
5. **Frontend build**: `cd frontend && npm run build`

## Part 2: Code Review

Follow `/review` criteria on the files being tested. Focus on:
- Correctness (does the logic make sense?)
- Error handling (what happens when things fail?)
- Edge cases (empty states, loading states, error states)

## Part 3: Functional Testing

**Actually test the feature works.** Use browser tools (Playwright) and/or curl.

### Setup
1. Start backend: `cd backend && uv run uvicorn main:app --port 8000 &`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev &`
3. Wait for both to be ready

### Test the feature
Based on what was implemented, exercise the actual functionality:
- Navigate to the relevant page
- Perform the user actions (click, type, submit)
- Verify expected results appear
- Check for console errors, network failures
- Test error states if applicable (what if API fails?)

### Cleanup
- Stop the servers when done

## Output Format

- [ ] Build: PASS/FAIL

### Code Review
- [ ] Correctness: PASS/FAIL — [notes]
- [ ] Error handling: PASS/FAIL — [notes]
- [ ] Edge cases: PASS/FAIL — [notes]

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Setup: Servers started successfully
- [ ] Feature test: [describe what was tested]
  - Step 1: [action] → [result] ✓/✗
  - Step 2: [action] → [result] ✓/✗
- [ ] Error states: [tested/not tested] — [result]
- [ ] Console errors: None / [list them]

### Issues Found
- [File:line] Description (from any part above)

### Summary
Feature works: YES / NO / PARTIAL
Issues to fix: X
```

## Scope

If testing specific files/features (e.g., from `/verify`), focus testing on those areas only. Don't test unrelated parts of the app.
