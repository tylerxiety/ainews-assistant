# Code Review Task

Perform comprehensive code review. Be thorough but concise.

## Check For:

- **Backend (Python/FastAPI)** - Correct async/await usage, Pydantic models for validation, proper HTTP status codes (4xx for client errors, not 500s).
- **Frontend (React)** - Exhaustive hook dependencies, proper useEffect cleanup, controlled components, avoid prop drilling.
- **TypeScript** - Strict typing (no `any`), comprehensive interfaces, proper return types, no `@ts-ignore`.
- **Cloud Services** - GCP/Supabase clients as singletons, no per-request re-initialization, proper connection cleanup.
- **Logging** - Python `logging` (no `print`), structured logs with context, no `console.log` in production.
- **Production Readiness** - No debug code, no TODOs, no hardcoded secrets, React error boundaries.
- **Performance** - Memoization for expensive ops, efficient data fetching (no request waterfalls), avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Security** - Input validation (Zod/Pydantic), Supabase RLS policies verified, environment variables for secrets.
- **Architecture** - Monorepo structure respected, clear separation of concerns, follows existing patterns.
- **Audio Playback** - Proper resource cleanup (audio elements unmounted), playback state managed correctly, no memory leaks from event listeners, handle audio loading errors gracefully.
- **PWA** - Service worker properly configured, manifest.json valid, offline fallback strategy defined, cache invalidation for updated audio.
