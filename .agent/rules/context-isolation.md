# Context Isolation
- **Strict Project Scope**: Do NOT use or reference conversation history, code snippets, or context from other repositories or projects.
- **Current Scope**: Only consider the history and files relevant to the current repository.
- **Ambiguity**: If a memory or retrieval seems unrelated to the current project's tech stack, ignore it.
