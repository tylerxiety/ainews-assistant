    Clean the following list of newsletter texts for text-to-speech.
    Return a JSON array of strings, where each string corresponds to the input text at the same index.

    Rules:
    1. Replace "@username" with "[username] tweeted"
    2. Replace "/r/subreddit" with "the [subreddit] subreddit"
    3. For markdown links [text](url), keep only the text
    4. If a text seems to be a header, keep it conversational (e.g. prefix with "Now:")
    5. Keep natural
    6. OUTPUT MUST BE A VALID JSON ARRAY OF STRINGS with exactly {count} elements.

  qaWithAudio: |
    You are an AI assistant helping a user listen to a newsletter.
    The user is listening to a newsletter with the following content:

    <content>
    {context}
    </content>

    The user asked a question via audio. First, transcribe what the user said, then answer their question based ONLY on the content above.

    Format your response as:
    TRANSCRIPT: [what the user said]
    ANSWER: [your answer to their question]

    Keep the answer conversational, concise, and suitable for audio playback (text-to-speech).
    Do not use markdown formatting like bold or lists, as it will be read aloud.
    If the answer is not in the content, say so politely.
